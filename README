SoxMusicGen
-----------

A Perl 5 module making it easier to create music with the power of SoX
synths as well as your custom samples.

If you're one of these people:

- a Perl programmer
- suck at reading sheet music
- finds MML too difficult
- too lazy to learn FamiTracker
- think that scientific note duration is the best thing since sliced bread
- used libsox.sh, the predecessor of this module

Then try this crappy module of mine!

Some features of this module:

- Easy to write syntax for inputting notes (e.g. "$qu:A4")
 - Inspired from korobeiniki.sh of the dsuni/bashtris repository
- Supports multiple note harmonies ("$ei:A4/C5")
 - Unlike before in libsox.sh you can do as many notes as you want!
  - Like this: "$dei:C6/A5/G5/B5/F4/D3/G3/B4"
- Supports every synth type included in SoX
- You can use your own samples as well
 - Your samples should be encoded in a format supported by SoX, like wav
- Adheres to the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well"

What this library doesn't support:

- Harmonies with different durations or instruments
 - e.g. countermelodies and background melodies
 - I suggest doing two separate scripts, sox them into two files, then
   play both either merged or mixed

Usage
-----

# Paste the following in your child script:

use lib 'path/to/module'; # most likely either .. or .
use SoXMusicGen;

our @notes;

setTempo(BPM); # Replace "BPM" with integer
setDefaultSynthType(""); # Choose from sin, square, triangle, pluck, etc.
our $maxSynthChannels=1; # Set as many as needed

# If using more than two channels...
setDefaultSynthType("", "", ""); # Number of synths set must match number
our $maxSynthChannels=4;         # of audio channels

# If you're using custom samples...
our $synthSampleRate=44100; # Your synth sample rate must match the SR of
                            # your custom samples, which might be 44.1kHz.
our $maxSamplesChannels=2; # How much notes of your custom samples to play
                           # at the same time. If your custom samples use 2
                           # channels per note, set $maxSynthChannels to 4.
                           # That's if you want to use both synths and samples
our $samplesDir="path/to/samples";   # Every file must be formatted as
                                     # NOTE.ext, like A#4.wav and C3.aiff

# To print the sox pipes...
createSynths(); # for synths
createSamples(); # for custom samples

# Refer to the child scripts included in this repo for more examples

Example child script syntax
---------------------------

./music.pl | xargs play -S -V1 # Plays into SoX once

./music.pl | xargs ./myplay-repeat.sh 1 # Plays into SoX twice

./music.pl | xargs ./mysox.sh music.wav # Saves into "music.wav" using SoX

./music.pl | head -n +37 | xargs play -S -V1 ; ./music.pl | tail -n +37 |
   xargs ./myplay-repeat.sh 3 # Plays line 1 to 37 of music.pl's output once,
                                 then plays the rest thrice

./music.pl | xargs ./mysox.sh - | cvlc - # Saves into stdout then pipes it into
                                           vlc
./music.pl > music.txt # Redirects music.pl's output to a text file

./music.pl | xclip -i # Copies music.pl's output to XA_PRIMARY
